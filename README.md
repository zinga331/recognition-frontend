# HTML deliverable

The following elements were implemented for the HTML assignment.

- **HTML pages** - Two HTML pages that represent the ability to log in and index records.
- **Links** - The login and register buttons on the login page both link to the index page. The log in/out button on the index page links to the login page.
- **Text** - Each field to index is represented by a textual description. The record types are also represented by text.
- **Images** - The indexing page contains an image of a sample French record. The login page currently contains the same image as well.
- **Login** - The login page has inputs for username and password, with options to both register and login. The indexing page displays the user name of the logged in user.
- **Database** - The image and initial field values represent content stored persistently in the database.
- **WebSocket** - The index page can display live notifications to the user in real time.

# CSS deliverable

The following elements were added for the CSS assignment.

- **Header, footer, and main content body** - the header and footer are offset with a different color and given fixed heights. The body takes up the remaining height of the page.
- **Navigation elements** - The login / logout link is placed in the header. I also formated the login/register buttons that link back to the index page.
- **Responsive to window resizing** - The header and footer have fixed heights, while the body resizes vertically to fill the remaining space. The image and form on each page also move and resize as the window changes.
- **Application elements** - I centered and placed the form elements for the pages. I also edited the color scheme for the elements.
- **Application text content** - I increased the size of the text and changed some of the colors. I also added margins and padding around the text.
- **Application images** - the image is placed within the left 66% of the page and resizes with the page.
