The following elements were implemented for the HTML assignment.

- **HTML pages** - Two HTML pages that represent the ability to log in and index records.
- **Links** - The login and register buttons on the login page both link to the index page. The log in/out button on the index page links to the login page.
- **Text** - Each field to index is represented by a textual description. The record types are also represented by text.
- **Images** - The indexing page contains an image of a sample French record. The login page currently contains the same image as well.
- **Login** - The login page has inputs for username and password, with options to both register and login. The indexing page displays the user name of the logged in user.
- **Database** - The image and initial field values represent content stored persistently in the database.
- **WebSocket** - The index page can display live notifications to the user in real time.
