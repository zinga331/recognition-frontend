# Automating deployment

> The advantage of using an automated deployment process is that it is reproducible. You don't accidentally delete a file, or misconfigure something with an stray keystroke. Also, having a automated script encourages you to iterate quickly because it is so much easier to deploy your code. You can add a small feature, deploy it out to production, and get feedback within minutes from your users.

> A deployment script exists for each of the Simon projects and you can use them, as is, for your startup application as long as you are doing similar types of deployment actions.

[Consider using a tutorial to help you with shell scripting when the time comes.](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php)
