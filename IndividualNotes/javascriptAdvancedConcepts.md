# Javascript regular expressions

## Basic uses of regular expressions

You ocan think of regular expression as textual pattern matchers. They are used to find patterns in strings, so you can simply replace the text, or know if it matches a pattern.

We can create a regular expression in two ways, the first is through the RegExp constructor, and the second is through the literal syntax:

```js
const objRegex = new RegExp("ab*", "i");
const literalRegex = /ab*/i;
```

Here are some use cases of regular expressions. First we return the matching patterns of the text, second we replace the maching paterns, and third, we test if the text matches the pattern.

```js
const petRegex = /(dog)|(cat)|(bird)/gim;
const text = "Both cats and dogs are pets, but not rocks.";

text.match(petRegex);
// RETURNS: ['cat', 'dog']

text.replace(petRegex, "animal");
// RETURNS: Both animals and animals are pets, but not rocks.

petRegex.test(text);
// RETURNS: true
```

## Rest and spread

Rest parameters are prefixed by three periods and must be the last variable in the function definition. They are used to collect all remaining arguments into an array. You can remember what "rest" does because it collects the "rest" of the arguments into an array.

```js
function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
```

Spread, on the other hand, does the opposite. it takess an iterable object (like an array or a string) and expans it into a function's parameters. Like so:

```js
function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...["Ryan", "Dahl"]);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
```

# Exceptions

JavaScript supports exeption handling like Java and other languages. You can throw an exception with the `throw` keyword, and catch it with the `try` and `catch` keywords.

```js
function connectDatabase() {
  throw new Error("connection error");
}

try {
  connectDatabase();
  console.log("never executed");
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err);
} finally {
  console.log("always executed");
}

// OUTPUT: Error: connection error
//         always executed
```

> [!NOTE]
> âš  When first using exception handling it is tempting to use it as way to handle normal flows of execution. For example, throwing a file not found exception when it is common for users to request nonexistent files. Throwing exceptions should only happen when something truly exceptional occurs. For example, a file not found exception when the file is required for your code to run, such as a required configuration file. Your code will be easier to debug, and your logs more meaningful if you restrict exceptions to truly exceptional situations.
