[Can I use is a good website](https://caniuse.com/?search=button) for checking browser compatibility for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features.

## index.html

> By default a web server will display the HTML file named `index.html` when a web browser, such as Google Chrome, makes a request without asking for a specific HTML file. For example, when you ask for `https://google.com` in your web browser you will actually get back the HTML for the file `https://google.com/index.html`. For this reason, it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application `index.html`.

## Block versus Inline elements:

> There is a distinction between structure elements that are block vs inline. A block element is meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure. An inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element. In other words, inline elements do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content. For example, the block element div (division) could have an inline element b in order to bring attention to a portion of its sub-text. Likewise a p (paragraph) element could have a span to mark the paragraph's sub-text as a person's name.

```html
<div>He said <b>don't</b> stress about HTML. Practice makes perfect</div>

<p>
  Classes like <span>CS 260, or Web Development</span> will require you to learn
  html
</p>
```

## Form Elements

Form elements used to be the only way a website could submit info to a server. Now, we can use JavaScript to send data to a server without reloading the page. However, forms are still useful for collecting user input. But for the purposes of CS 260, they won't be required.

## Input element

The input element represents many different input types. You set the type of input with the `type` attribute. There are several different types to choose from. This includes different flavors of textual, numeric, date, and color inputs.

| Type           | Meaning                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| text           | Single line textual value         |
| password       | Obscured password                 |
| email          | Email address                     |
| tel            | Telephone number                  |
| url            | URL address                       |
| number         | Numerical value                   |
| checkbox       | Inclusive selection               |
| radio          | Exclusive selection               |
| range          | Range limited number              |
| date           | Year, month, day                  |
| datetime-local | Date and time                     |
| month          | Year, month                       |
| week           | Week of year                      |
| color          | Color                             |
| file           | Local file                        |
| submit         | button to trigger form submission |

In order to create an input you specify the desired `type` attribute along with any other attribute associated with that specific input. Here is an example of a checked radio button and its associated label.

```html
<label for="checkbox1">Check me</label>
<input type="checkbox" name="varCheckbox" value="checkbox1" checked />
```

Most input elements share some common attributes. These include the following.

| Attribute | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name      | The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form |
| disabled  | Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input                        |
| value     | The initial value of the input                                                      |
| required  | Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid                             |

By the way, if you want to specify the default color for a color input, you'll need to specify the color as an input value. For example, `value="#ff0000"`.

## HTML Media elements

HTML has several different media elements, I'd refer to the readme by Dr. Jensen on this topic:

[HTML Media Elements](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/html/media/media.md)

## Helpful Tips for Later

> [!NOTE] You can select a radio button or dropdown option by default by adding the `checked` attribute to the input element. This also works with check boxes.
