## index.html

> By default a web server will display the HTML file named `index.html` when a web browser, such as Google Chrome, makes a request without asking for a specific HTML file. For example, when you ask for `https://google.com` in your web browser you will actually get back the HTML for the file `https://google.com/index.html`. For this reason, it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application `index.html`.
