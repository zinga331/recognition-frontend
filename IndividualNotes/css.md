## CSS definitions

![CSS Definitions](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/css/introduction/cssDefinitions.jpg)

There are three ways to add CSS to an HTML document:

- Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements

```html
<p style="color:green">CSS</p>
```

- Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section

```html
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>CSS</p>
</body>
```

- External - by using an external CSS file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

**styles.css**

```css
p {
  color: green;
}
```

### The box model

> CSS defines everything as boxes. When you apply styles, you are applying them to a region of the display that is a rectangular box. Within an element's box there are several internal boxes. The innermost box holds the element's content. This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed. Next comes the padding. The padding will inherit things like the background color. After padding is the border, which has properties like color, thickness and line style. The final box is the margin. The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace. It is important to understand each of these boxes so that you can achieve the desired visual result by applying the proper CSS declaration.

## CSS Selectors

### Combinators

> Next we want to change the color of the second level headings (`h2`), but we only want to do that within the sections for each department. To make that happen we can provide a `descendant combinator` that is defined with a space delimited list of values where each item in the list is a descendant of the previous item. So our selector would be all `h2` elements that are descendants of `section` elements.

```css
section h2 {
  color: #004400;
}
```

> There are other types of combinators that you can use. These include the following.

| Combinator       | Meaning                    | Example        | Description                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Descendant       | A list of descendants      | `body section` | Any section that is a descendant of a body |
| Child            | A list of direct children  | `section > p`  | Any p that is a direct child of a section  |
| General sibling  | A list of siblings         | `p ~ div`      | Any p that has a div sibling               |
| Adjacent sibling | A list of adjacent sibling | `p + div`      | Any p that has an adjacent div sibling     |

> We can use the general sibling combinator to increase the whitespace padding on the left of paragraphs that are siblings of a level two heading.

```css
h2 ~ p {
  padding-left: 0.5em;
}
```

## Class selectors

> The next selector we will use is the class selector. Remember that any element can have zero or more classifications applied to it. For example, our document has a class of `introduction` applied to the first paragraph, and a class of `summary` applied to the final paragraph of each section. If we want to bold the summary paragraphs we would supply the class name summary prefixed with a period (`.summary`).

```css
.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

> You can also combine the element name and class selectors to select all paragraphs with a class of summary.

```css
p.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

### ID selector

> ID selectors reference the ID of an element. All IDs should be unique within an HTML document and so this select targets a specific element. To use the ID selector you prefix the ID with the hash symbol (`#`). We would like to showcase our physics department by putting a thin purple border along the left side of the physics section.

```css
#physics {
  border-left: solid 1em purple;
}
```

### Attribute selector

> Attribute selectors allow you to select elements based upon their attributes. You use an attribute selector to select any element with a given attribute (`a[href]`). You can also specify a required value for an attribute (`a[href="./fish.png"]`) in order for the selector to match. Attribute selectors also support wildcards such as the ability to select attribute values containing specific text (`p[href*="https://"]).

```css
p[class="summary"] {
  color: red;
}
```

> For a full description of attribute selections refer to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors).

### Pseudo selector

> CSS also defines a significant list of pseudo selectors which select based on positional relationships, mouse interactions, hyperlink visitation states, and attributes. We will give just one example. Suppose we want our purple highlight bar to appear only when the mouse hovers over the text. To accomplish this we can change our ID selector to select whenever a section is hovered over.

```css
section:hover {
  border-left: solid 1em purple;
}
```

## CSS Declarations

> [!NOTE]
> The following notes are taken directly from the 260 github. I take no credit for the wording, instead I wanted to have these on hand.

ðŸ“– **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN reference section on properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)

CSS rule declarations specify a property and value to assign when the rule selector matches one or more elements. There are legions of possible properties defined for modifying the style of an HTML document. For our purposes we will discuss just a few of the more commonly used ones so that you can get a feel for wide variety of functionality they represent.

### Units

ðŸ“– **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Values and units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units)

You can use a variety of units when defining the size of a CSS property. For example, the width of an element can be defined using absolute units such as the number of pixels (`px`) or inches (`in`). You can also use relative units such as a percentage of the parent element (`50%`), a percentage of a minimum viewport dimension (`25vmin`), or a multiplier of the size of the letter m (`1.5rem`) as defined by the root element.

```css
p {
  width: 25%;
  height: 30vh;
}
```

Here is a list of the most commonly used units. All of the units are prefixed with a number when used as a property value.

| Unit | Description                                                      |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| px   | The number of pixels                                             |
| pt   | The number of points (1/72 of an inch)                           |
| in   | The number of inches                                             |
| cm   | The number of centimeters                                        |
| %    | A percentage of the parent element                               |
| em   | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the parent's font |
| rem  | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the root's font   |
| ex   | A multiplier of the height of the element's font                 |
| vw   | A percentage of the viewport's width                             |
| vh   | A percentage of the viewport's height                            |
| vmin | A percentage of the viewport's smaller dimension                 |
| vmax | A percentage of the viewport's larger dimension                  |

### Color

ðŸ“– **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Applying color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Applying_color)

CSS defines multiple ways to describe color, ranging from representations familiar to programmers and ones familiar to layout designers and artists.

| Method       | Example                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| keyword      | `red`                     | A set of predefined colors (e.g. white, cornflowerblue, darkslateblue)                                                                                                                                            |
| RGB hex      | `#00FFAA22` or `#0FA2`    | Red, green, and blue as a hexadecimal number, with an optional alpha opacity                                                                                                                                      |
| RGB function | `rgb(128, 255, 128, 0.5)` | Red, green, and blue as a percentage or number between 0 and 255, with an optional alpha opacity percentage                                                                                                       |
| HSL          | `hsl(180, 30%, 90%, 0.5)` | Hue, saturation, and light, with an optional opacity percentage. Hue is the position on the 365 degree color wheel (red is 0 and 255). Saturation is how gray the color is, and light is how bright the color is. |

### Experiment

âš  This [CodePen](https://codepen.io/zinga331/pen/BavGzMW) demonstrates the use of many of the above declarations. I've forked the original so I have it a copy of it for use in the future.
