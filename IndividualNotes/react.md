# React introduction

React abstracts HTML into a JavaScript variant called [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). It is then converted into valit HTML and JavaScript using a preprocessor called [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). The following is a JSX file, and it mixess both HTLM and JavaScript into a single representation.

```jsx
const i = 3;
const list = (
  <ol class='big'>
    <li>Item {i}</li>
    <li>Item {3 + i}</li>
  </ol>
);
```

Babel will convert that into valid JavaScript:

```js
const i = 3;
const list = React.createElement(
  'ol',
  { class: 'big' },
  React.createElement('li', null, 'Item ', i),
  React.createElement('li', null, 'Item ', 3 + i)
);
```

> The `React.createElement` function will then generate DOM elements and monitor the data they represent for changes. When a change is discovered, React will trigger dependent changes.

# Components

> React components allow you to modularize the functionality of your application. This allows the underlying code to directly represent the components that a user interacts with. It also enables code reuse as common application components often show up repeatedly.

## Render function

One of the priary purposes of a component is to generate the user interface. This is done by defining a `render` function that returns a JSX representation of the component. Whatever is returned from the `render` function is inserted into the component HTML element.

> As a simple example, a JSX file containing a React component element named `Demo` would cause React to load the `Demo` component, call the `render` function, and insert the result into the place of the `Demo` element.

**JSX**

```jsx
<div>
  Component: <Demo />
</div>
```

Notice that `Demo` is not a valid HTML element. The transpiler will replace this tag with the resulting rendered HTML.

**React component**

```js
function Demo() {
  const who = 'world';
  return <b>Hello {who}</b>;
}
```

**Resulting HTML**

```html
<div>Component: <b>Hello world</b></div>
```

## Props

React componenets also allow you to pass information to them in the form of element properties. The componenet receives the properties in its constructor and then can display them when it renders.

**JSX**

```jsx
<div>Component: <Demo who="Walke" /><div>
```

**React component**

```jsx
function Demo(props) {
  return <b>Hello {props.who}</b>;
}
```

**Resulting HTML**

```html
<div>Component: <b>Hello Walke</b></div>
```

## State

In addition to properties, a component can have internal state. Component state is created by calling the `React.useState` hook function. The `useState` function returns a variable that contains the current state and a function to update the state. The following example creates a state variable called `clicked` and toggles the click state in the `updateClicked` function that gets called when the paragraph text is clicked.

```jsx
const Clicker = () => {
  const [clicked, updateClicked] = React.useState(false);

  const onClicked = (e) => {
    updateClicked(!clicked);
  };

  return <p onClick={(e) => onClicked(e)}>clicked: {`${clicked}`}</p>;
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clicker />);
```

You should note that you can use JSX even without a function. A simple variable representing JSX will work anyplace you would otherwise provide a component.

```jsx
const hello = <div>Hello</div>;

ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Class style components

In addition to the preferred `function style` components demonstrated above, React also supports `class style` components. However, you should note that the React team is moving away from the class style representation, and for that reason you should probably not use it. With that said, you are likely to see class style components and so you should be aware of the syntax. Below is the equivalent class style component for the `Clicker` component that we created above.

The major difference is that properties are loaded on the constructor and state is set using a `setState` function on the component object.

```jsx
class Clicker extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      clicked: false,
    };
  }
  onClicked() {
    this.setState({
      clicked: !this.state.clicked,
    });
  }
  render() {
    return <p onClick={(e) => this.onClicked(e)}>clicked: {`${this.state.clicked}`}</p>;
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clicker />);
```
## Reactivity

A component's properties and state are used by the React framework to determine the reactivity of the interface. Reactivity controls how a component reacts to actions taken by the user or events that happen within the application. Whenever a component's state or properties change, the `render` function for the component and all of its dependent component `render` functions are called.


## â˜‘ Assignment

Create a fork of this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/Yzvaver) and experiment.

[My Fork](https://codepen.io/zinga331/pen/MWLZwzV)

Try the following:

1. Add a new property to the Demo component that provides the background color for the component.
2. Add another state variable that changes the color on a mouse over event.

When you are done submit your CodePen URL to the Canvas assignment.

# Toolchains (notes by Prof. Jensen)


As web programming becomes more and more complex it became necessary to abstract away some of that complexity with a series of tools. Some common functional pieces in a web application tool chain include:

- **Code repository** - Stores code in a shared, versioned, location.
- **Linter** - Removes, or warns, of non-idiomatic code usage.
- **Prettier** - Formats code according to a shared standard.
- **Transpiler** - Compiles code into a different format. For example, from JSX to JavaScript, TypeScript to JavaScript, or SCSS to CSS.
- **Polyfill** - Generates backward compatible code for supporting old browser versions that do not support the latest standards.
- **Bundler** - Packages code into bundles for delivery to the browser. This enables compatibility (for example with ES6 module support), or performance (with lazy loading).
- **Minifier** - Removes whitespace and renames variables in order to make code smaller and more efficient to deploy.
- **Testing** - Automated tests at multiple levels to ensure correctness.
- **Deployment** - Automated packaging and delivery of code from the development environment to the production environment.

The toolchain that we use for our React project consists of [GitHub](https://github.com/) as the code repository, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for JSX, TS, development and debugging support, [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for converting to ES6 modules and transpiling (with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) underneath), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for bundling and tree shaking, [PostCSS]() for CSS transpiling, and finally a simple bash script (deployReact.sh) for deployment.

You don't have to fully understand what each of these pieces in the chain are accomplishing, but the more you know about them the more you can optimize your development efforts.

In the following instruction we will show you how to use Vite to create a simple web application using the tools mentioned above. We will then demonstrate how to convert your startup into a modern web application by converting Simon to use Vite and React.
