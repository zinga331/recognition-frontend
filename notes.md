## SERVICE DELIVERABLES

[Link to service deliverables](./README.md/#service-deliverable).

## JAVASCRIPT DELIVERABLES

The following elements were added for the JavaScript assignment.

- **JavaScript support for future login.** - The login and register buttons read in the username and save it to local storage. This name is read back and displayed on the home page. The logout button clears this data from local storage.
- **JavaScript support for future database data.** - Storage of username in database is simulated by local storage. The document image on the homepage corresponds to the language selected by the user. The page supports adding and deleting rows from the table, and simulates submitting the data to the database.
- **JavaScript support for future WebSocket.** - On login, user is prompted to opt-in or opt-out of notifications. If opted-in, notifications periodically appear for about thirty seconds. The latest notification can be viewed by clicking the notification button.
- **JavaScript support application's interaction logic.** - Users can add and remove new fields from the table while indexing. The table populates on page load based on the results from the database queries.

## CSS ASSIGNMENT DELIVERABLES

- _Header, Footer, and main content body_ - The header, footer, and main content body are styled with a background color, and the main content body is centered.
- _Navigation elements_ - The navigation elements are appropriately sized, and the links are styled with an underline upon hover. all buttons, including navigation buttons, also feature a background color change upon hover.
- _Responsive to window resizing_ - Padding and element sizes respond to window resizing.
- _Application elements_ - Index entry table and login are styled to be centered and look better. The buttons and index page slideshow placeholder are styled with a hover effect. Notification Settings box is styled with a border and radio buttons mapped near their text.
- _Application text content_ - The text content is styled with a font group, and font color appropriate to each element.
- _Application images_ - The images are styled with a border and the index page image has a hover animation.
- _Git Commits_ - periodic commits to display progress.

### Grading Criteria

- **Simon CSS deployed to your production environment**
- **A link to your GitHub startup repository prominently displayed on your application's home page**
- **Notes in your startup Git repository README.md file documenting what you modified and added with this deliverable.** The TAs will only grade things that have been clearly described as being completed. Review the [voter app](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md#css-deliverable) as an example.

### When formatting your notes, use the docs explaining writing on github to make things look pretty

[Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings)

### Code can be edited directly through github, or on one of the related repository branches.

You'll notice the different levels that are used in this. The main heading used a single pound symbol, and the next used two of them.
Some basic Git commands are:

```
git status
git add
git commit
```

> [!NOTE]

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

Importantly, you can add links to different text for later use [like the link you see here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)
