# Christian Hall's Notes and Deliverables

## JAVASCRIPT DELIVERABLES

### Personal notes on what to do for the deliverable:

- Add functionality to simulate logging in, displaying the user's name, based on what they entered with register or login.

- Add functionality to update the size of the table, by deleting or adding rows.

- Simulate getting a random image from the server and displaying it, rather than the same image every time.

- Show some way of doing notifications, like a popup or something.

## CSS ASSIGNMENT DELIVERABLES

- _Header, Footer, and main content body_ - The header, footer, and main content body are styled with a background color, and the main content body has a border.
- _Navigation elements_ - The navigation elements are styled with a background color, and the links are styled with a hover effect.

### Grading Criteria

- **Simon CSS deployed to your production environment**
- **A link to your GitHub startup repository prominently displayed on your application's home page**
- **Notes in your startup Git repository README.md file documenting what you modified and added with this deliverable.** The TAs will only grade things that have been clearly described as being completed. Review the [voter app](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md#css-deliverable) as an example.

## HTML ASSIGNMENT DELIVERABLES

- _HTML pages_ - Two HTML pages that represent the ability to log in and index records.
- _Links_ -Links at the top of the page that allow users to navigate between the two pages.
- _Fill-out Form_ - A form that allows users index records by selecting a record category and verifying information served from the database.
- _Images_ -Landing page hosts a dummy indexing banner, and the indexing page hosts a dummy image served from the database.
- _Login_ - the main index page will have a login form that will allow users to log in or register. The header on top displayes the name of the current user.

## When formatting your notes, use the docs explaining writing on github to make things look pretty

[Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings)

## Code can be edited directly through github, or on one of the related repository branches.

You'll notice the different levels that are used in this. The main heading used a single pound symbol, and the next used two of them.
Some basic Git commands are:

```
git status
git add
git commit
```

> [!NOTE]
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

Importantly, you can add links to different text for later use [like the link you see here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)
