## When formatting your notes, use the docs explaining writing on github to make things look pretty

[Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings)

## Code can be edited directly through github, or on one of the related repository branches.

You'll notice the different levels that are used in this. The main heading used a single pound symbol, and the next used two of them.
Some basic Git commands are:

```
git status
git add
git commit
```

> [!NOTE]
