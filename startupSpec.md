<!-- This should include an elevator pitch, key features, a description of how you will use each technology, and design images. -->

# Elevator Pitch

    Indexing is a delicate process that requires a lot of trust in the participants.  We are building a system that will allow for the indexing of documents one page at a time, supported by machine learning. This will allow for the indexing of documents to be done by a larger group of people, and will allow for the indexing to be done more quickly and more accurately.

# Key Features

- User authentication through FamilySearch.org
-

# Description of how you will use each technology

- HTML - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. A landing page, a login page, and the main page where the indexing will take place.
- CSS - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- TypeScript - Provides login, FamilySearch API, and database services.
- Service - Backend service with endpoints for:
- familysearch authentication
- Machine learning API
- DB - Store family records and user information.
- Login - Authenticate through family search.
- WebSocket - Server notifications sent from us to users.
- React - Frontend will be developed in react

<!-- Your application needs to demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, calling web services, providing web services, authentication, storing data persistently, and using web sockets for sending realtime data to and from your server. -->
<!-- Authentication: An input for your user to create an account and login. You will want to display the user's name after they login.
Database data: A rendering of application data that is stored in the database. For Simon, this is the high scores of all players.
WebSocket data: A rendering of data that is received from your server. This may be realtime data sent from other users (e.g. chat or scoring data), or realtime data that your service is generating (e.g. stock prices or latest high scores). For Simon, this represents every time another user creates or ends a game. -->
