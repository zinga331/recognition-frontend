# Elevator Pitch

    Indexing is a delicate process that requires a lot of trust in the participants.  We are building a system that will allow for the indexing of documents one page at a time, supported by machine learning. This will allow for the indexing of documents to be done by a larger group of people, and will allow for the indexing to be done more quickly and more accurately.
